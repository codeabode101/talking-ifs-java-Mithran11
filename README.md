# Talking in Java

You can create ANY conversation you want in Java. There must be at least 3 turns.

Here is an example:

```bash
Turn 1: (1) Say hi, (2) Ask for their name, (3) Slap them: 3

You slap them.
Joe: How dare you?

Turn 2: (1) Slap him again, (2) Run away: 2

You run away.
Joe chases you.

Turn 3: (1) Fight him, (2) Quit, (3) Say sorry, (4) Continue running: 4

You continue running.
Joe slows down.
```

You have to code a path for each option. If I asked for their name there should be a story for 3 turns. If I said hi, there should also be a story.
